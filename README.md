#### This program was created in a three-week course by 5 students, studying computer science in Reykjavík University, 2015.

#### 1. About the program
*The program stores some facts about scientits that have contributed to computer science. The user can add new scientists, edit scientists that have already been added and retrieve facts about them.
*Written in C++ language.

#### 2. How the program works
*The program reads an input file and creates a list of scientists. It stores the scientist's name, age, sex, year of birth and year of death. The user can add new scientists to the file, edit scientists that are already in the file and remove scientists. The user can get a sorted results from the program. The program then saves all modifications to file.
